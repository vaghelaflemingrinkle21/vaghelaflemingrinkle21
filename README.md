## 👋 Howdy, I’m Rinkle 

I’m an analytics professional with a strong foundation in data science and a clear interest in solving real-world business problems using data.

I work best in environments where data is imperfect, decisions matter, and analytical clarity directly impacts outcomes. My approach combines technical rigor with business awareness — I care not just about *what* the data says, but *how* it should be used.

### 🧠 How I Approach Data
I believe strong analytics is less about tools and more about judgment.

For me, that means:
- understanding the business context before building solutions  
- choosing methods that balance accuracy, interpretability, and cost  
- evaluating results using both statistical metrics and real-world impact  
- communicating insights clearly so they influence decisions  

I’m particularly interested in analytics that support **risk assessment, prioritization, and operational decision-making**.

- Strong analytical thinking grounded in business logic  
- Comfort working across analytics, reporting, and applied modeling
